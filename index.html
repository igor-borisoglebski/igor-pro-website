        <p>My passion for technology and engineering led my career to an executive officer role where I served as CTO. Previously, I had more hands on roles starting from technical support teams at a call center and then evolving progressively to the engineering leadership of a global service provider. This myriad of experiences allowed me to be able to design and implement impactful business strategies which were meaningfully connected to the customers, employees and investors best interests. The pioneering and innovation spirit I was part of led me to become a co-inventor of several patents. <br>Looking back, I consider myself to have been very fortunate in sharing extremelly diverse and challenging work experiences with brilliant colleagues and top professionals who taught me what good looks like.</p>
